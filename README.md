# BetterRest ðŸ˜´

## What is it about?

### BetterRest app is the fourth project in the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course, by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws), I learned about: Stepper, DatePicker, DateFormatter, and CoreML through days 26-28. 

## How does it work?
### Input what the app is asking and a trained ML model will answer when you should go to bed.
